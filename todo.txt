* Check commit 13f8e6f (conversion from long to double)
* Create a .cpp for non template code:
      - multibody/model.cpp
      - multibody/parser/urdf.cpp
* Re-organize the python modules, in eigenpy and pinocchio. Eigenpy should be a module (now loaded by pinocchio).
* Add computation of 3d jacobian
* Add algo to compute the velocity, acceleration of a point attached to a body
* Add computation of dM/dq, db/dq, db/dqdot, etc
* Add joint limit ( probably in joint-base ) and modify parser consequently
* Link with FCL to store the geometry of the robot.
* Merge with HPP-MODEL.

=== Wrapping of the Joint classes === 
* Introduce MotionBase, ForceBase, (InertiaBase), ConstraintBase.
* CRTP the definition of a JointSpec.
* Introducte JointGeneric and ConstraintGeneric.
* Wrap JointGeneric with Python. 

* Add additionnal in data structure to avoid useless computations
